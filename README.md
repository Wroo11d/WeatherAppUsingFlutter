# WeatherAppUsingFlutter

## Overview

This is a README file that provides an overview of the structure and components of a weather app built using Flutter. The app utilizes various folders and files within the `lib` directory, along with external dependencies managed through `pubspec.yaml`.

## Folder Structure

The `lib` directory contains several folders that organize the codebase:

### cubit

This folder is responsible for state management. It contains the necessary files to handle the app's state and perform state transitions.

### models

The models folder contains the data models required for fetching weather, location, and forecast. These models define the structure of the data returned from the API.

### pages

This folder holds all the app's pages and related components. Examples of pages could include the search page, detail description page, and more. Components specific to each page are also included within this folder.

### services

The services folder contains the necessary files to interact with external services, such as the weather API. In this case, the app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. The API key, has been provided via email for privacy purposes.

## Main File

The main file, `main.dart`, serves as the entry point of the Flutter app. It coordinates the initialization of the app and ties together various components.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes external dependencies managed through `pubspec.yaml`. These dependencies are responsible for providing additional functionality and simplifying certain tasks within the app. Make sure to check the `pubspec.yaml` file for the specific dependencies used in the project.

## Getting Started

To set up the weather app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. If not, please refer to the Flutter documentation for installation instructions.
3. Open the project.
4. Locate the `pubspec.yaml` file and run the command `flutter pub get` to fetch the required dependencies.
5. Once the dependencies are installed, connect your device or emulator.
6. Run the command `flutter run` in the project directory to launch the app on your device or emulator.
